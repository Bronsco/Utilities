-&gt; Splitting in dimension 1 with ratio 0.50: J = 0.010192 and penalty = 0.013784.

Estimated model complexity limit reached. The improvement of 
the loss function (penaltyLossFunction) was 2 times less than 
1.000000e-12 on TRAINING data.


Final net has 41 local models and 123 parameters: J = 0.010192

Net 39 with 39 LMs and 117 parameters is suggested as the model with the best complexity trade-off.
Plot model for dimensions 1 and 2.
